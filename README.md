# Swedish books

A page where you can see all original Swedish novels published by year and available for borrow in a library.

# Why?

I want to read more Swedish original works, and when I asked at my local library, they had no good way to find original works published in Swedish.

But I also want to highlight more today unknown/forgotten Swedish authors and works, since there are a lot of Swedish books that are currently stored in storage where the public is not allowed to browse, so the discoverability of those books are limited.
